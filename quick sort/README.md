The code you provided implements the QuickSort algorithm in Java. QuickSort is a popular sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach. It selects a pivot element, rearranges the array so that elements less than the pivot are on its left and elements greater than the pivot are on its right, and then recursively sorts the sub-arrays on either side of the pivot.
